# Cisco DevNet Create 2019: Packaging Network Automations with Docker

This repository contains presentation and the files required for the participants of the Packaging Network Automations with Docker workshop presented at Cisco DevNet Create 2019.  


Developing Cisco NetOps workflows with tools like Python, Ansible, etc. has never been easier. However, there are challenges associated with distribution and sharing. In this workshop I'll walk participants through using Docker to package network automations including Python and Cisco Network Services Orchestrator.

## Prerequisites
* [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/get-started) or [Docker Toolbox](https://github.com/docker/toolbox/releases)
* [Cisco Network Services Orchestrator](https://developer.cisco.com/docs/nso/#!getting-nso) for Linux
